Wrote a fresh implementation of most of the popular samplers and schedulers used for image generation (Stable Diffusion and Flux) at [https://github.com/cmdr2/samplers.cpp](https://github.com/cmdr2/samplers.cpp). A few other schedulers (like `Align Your Steps`) have been left out for now, but are pretty easy to implement.

It's still work-in-progress, and is not ready for public use. The algorithmic port has been completed, and the next step is to test the output values against reference values (from another implementation, e.g. Forge WebUI). After that, I'll translate it to C++.

This library is necessary for sdkit v3 (being designed for the upcoming Easy Diffusion v4), since we need a C++ implementation of the sampling and scheduling code. Samplers and schedulers are a major part of the "glue code" that tie together the various [models being executed](https://cmdr2.github.io/notes/2025/10/1760088945/) on the GPU.
