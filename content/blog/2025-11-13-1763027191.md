[PolyBlocks](https://docs.polymagelabs.com/) is another interesting ML compiler, written using MLIR. It's a startup incubated in IISc Bangalore, run by someone (Uday Bondhugula) who co-authored a [paper on compiler optimizations for GPGPUs](https://www.ece.lsu.edu/jxr/Publications-pdf/ics08.pdf) back in 2008 (17 years ago)!

Some of the compiler passes to keep in mind:
- fusion
- tiling
- use hardware acceleration (like tensor cores)
- constant folding
- perform redundant computation to avoid global memory accesses where profitable
- pack into buffers
- loop transformation
- unroll-and-jam (register tiling?)
- vectorization
- reorder execution for better spatial, temporary and group reuse

Scheduling approaches:
- greedy heuristics
- ILP
- dynamic programming
- analytical cost models

For fusion, PolyBlocks uses a Polyhedral slicing-based approach in the affine pass of MLIR. This approach seems to perform better than simple fusion (done by XLA and TorchInductor). Need to read about this some more.

[Important optimizations for matrix multiplication kernels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LLzHKeL2hs) (to get really close to cuBLAS performance):
- Shared Memory Tiling
- Register Tiling
- Padding (to avoid Shared Memory Bank conflicts)
- Load/Store Vectorization (from global memory to shared)
- Fetch the data for the next iteration (of a loop) while processing the current iteration

Some other random notes:
- User-facing API: TensorRT-style AOT compiled engine files, or Torch/Mojo/PolyBlocks-style JIT compilers inside Python, or in between (e.g. TensorRT-RTX).
- For the host-side code (i.e. the code that talks to the driver), it might be a good idea to generate C++ code that people can compile themselves (for power users). But this would add more hoops for the user to jump through, so this might be an option?
- Quantization hardware-awareness in the compiler is important, so that it can factor that in during tiling and memory layout.
