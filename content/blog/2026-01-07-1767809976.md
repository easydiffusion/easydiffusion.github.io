Worked on fixing Z-Image support in ED's fork of chromaForge (a fork of Forge WebUI). Fixed a number of integration issues. It's now crashing on a matrix multiplication error, which looks like an incorrectly transposed matrix (mostly due to reading the weights in the wrong order).

I'll try to install a stock version of chromaForge to see its raw performance with Z-Image (and whether it's worth pursuing the integration), and also use it to help investigate the matrix multiplication error (and any future errors).
