Worked on a few UI design ideas for Easy Diffusion v4. I've uploaded the work-in-progress mockups at [https://github.com/easydiffusion/files](https://github.com/easydiffusion/files).

So far, I've mocked out the design for the outer skeleton. That is, the new tabbed interface, the status bar, and the unified main menu. I also worked on how they would look like on mobile devices.

It gives me a rough idea of the `Vue` components that would need to be written, and the surface area that plugins can impact. For e.g. plugins can add a new menu entry only in the `Plugins` sub-menu.

The mockups draw inspiration from earlier version of Easy Diffusion (obviously), Google Chrome, Firefox, and VS Code.
