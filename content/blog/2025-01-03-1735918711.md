Spent a few days prototyping a UI for Easy Diffusion v4. Files are at [this repo](https://github.com/easydiffusion/files/blob/main/ED4-ui-design/prototype).

The main focus was to get a simple but pluggable UI, that was backed by a reactive data model, and to allow splitting the codebase into individual components (with their own files). And require only a text editor and a browser to develop, i.e. no compilation or nodejs-based developer experiences.

I really want something that is easy to understand - for an outside developer and for myself (for e.g. if I'm returning to a portion of the codebase after a while). And with very little friction to start developing for it.

It uses Vue, but directly in the browser. I use [vue3-sfc-loader](https://github.com/FranckFreiburger/vue3-sfc-loader) to allow the UI to be divided into separate component files, without requiring compilation.

I got a basic tabbed interface shell working, and laid out the foundational data structures, and tested that plugins could add new tabs as well.

Next, I'm going to experiment with [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/) for fleshing out a simple UI. I looked at quite a few UI libraries (including classic Bootstrap), and PrimeVue seems closest to my own mindset - like if I designed a UI library, it would look a lot like PrimeVue. And it seems to have most of the components that I require.
