Spent the last few days writing [torchruntime](https://github.com/easydiffusion/torchruntime), which will automatically install the correct torch distribution based on the user's OS and graphics card. This package was written by extracting this logic out of Easy Diffusion, and refactoring it into a cleaner implementation (with tests).

It can be installed (on Win/Linux/Mac) using `pip install torchruntime`.

The main intention is that it'll be easier for developers to contribute updates (for e.g. for newer or older GPUs). It wasn't easy to find or modify this code previously, since it was buried deep inside Easy Diffusion's internals.

Additionally, this package is useful to other developers who're building PyTorch-based apps that target users with NVIDIA/AMD/Intel graphics cards on Windows/Linux/Mac. The logic inside this package originates from a lot of user support and bug reports over the years in Easy Diffusion, and a bunch of research on the Internet (for the variety of combinations and settings required for AMD).
