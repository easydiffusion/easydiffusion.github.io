Wrote a simple script to convert ONNX to GGML. It auto-generates C++ code that calls the corresponding ggml functions (for each ONNX operator). This file can then be compiled and run like a normal C++ ggml program, and will produce the same results as the original model in PyTorch.

The generated file can work on multiple backends: CPU, CUDA, ROCm, Vulkan, Metal etc, by providing the correct compiler flags during `cmake -B`, e.g. `-D GGML_CUDA=1` for CUDA.

I've currently got it to work for a TinyCNN model, and will add more operators as I make it convert larger models.
