For Z-Image, the performance of the stock version of chromaForge is poorer than sd.cpp's. Mainly because chromaForge isn't able to run the smaller gguf quantized models that sd.cpp is able to run (chromaForge fails with the errors that I was fixing yesterday).

If I really want to push through with this, it would be good to fix the remaining issues with gguf models in chromaForge. Only then can the performance be truly compared (in order to decide whether to release this into ED 3.5). I want to compare the performance of the smaller gguf models, because that's what ED's users will run typically.
