Worked on adding support for DirectML in sdkit. This allows AMD GPUs and Integrated GPUs to generate images on Windows.

DirectML seems like it's really inefficient with memory though. So for now it only manages to generate images using SD 1.5. XL and larger models fail to generate, even though I have a 12 GB of VRAM in my graphics card.
