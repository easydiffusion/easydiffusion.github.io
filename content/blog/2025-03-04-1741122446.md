Upgraded the default version of Easy Diffusion to Python 3.9. Newer versions of torch don't support Python 3.8, so this became urgent after the release of NVIDIA's 50xx series GPUs.

I choose 3.9 as a temporary fix (instead of a newer Python version), since it had the least amount of package conflicts. The future direction of Easy Diffusion's backend is unclear right now - there are a bunch of possible paths. So I didn't want to spend too much time on this. I also wanted to minimize the risk to existing users.
