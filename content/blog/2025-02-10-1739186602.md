Spent the last week or two getting [torchruntime](https://github.com/easydiffusion/torchruntime/) fully integrated into Easy Diffusion, and making sure that it handles all the edge-cases.

Easy Diffusion now uses `torchruntime` to automatically install the best-possible version of `torch` (on the users' computer) and support a wider variety of GPUs (as well as older GPUs). And it uses a GPU-agnostic device API, so Easy Diffusion will automatically support additional GPUs when they are supported by `torchruntime`.

This also makes it easier for developers to add support for more (or newer) GPUs in a simpler code base (i.e. [torchruntime](https://github.com/easydiffusion/torchruntime/)), instead of digging into the internals of Easy Diffusion's codebase.

This removes a lot of custom, hacky code from Easy Diffusion for installing torch. This hacky code was the initial source of knowledge for `torchruntime`, and I'm thankful to all the contributors who poured their knowledge into it.
