The design constraints for Easy Diffusion's next engine (i.e. sdkit v3) are:
* Lean: Install size of < 200 MB uncompressed (excluding models).
* Fast: Performance within 10% of the best-possible speed on that GPU for that model.
* Capable: Supports Stable Diffusion 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, XL, Flux, Chroma, ControlNet, LORA, Embedding, VAE. Supports loading custom model weights (from civitai etc).
* Targets: Desktops and Laptops, Windows/Linux/Mac, NVIDIA/AMD/Intel/Apple.

I think it's possible, using ML compilers like TensorRT-RTX (and similar compilers for other platforms).
