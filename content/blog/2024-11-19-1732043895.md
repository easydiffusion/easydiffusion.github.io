Spent a few days getting a C++ based version of Easy Diffusion working, using stable-diffusion.cpp. I'm working with a fork of stable-diffusion.cpp [here](https://github.com/cmdr2/stable-diffusion.cpp), to add a few changes like per-step callbacks, live image previews etc.

It doesn't have a UI yet, and currently hardcodes a model path. It exposes a RESTful API server (written using the `Crow` C++ library), and uses a simple task manager that runs image generation tasks on a thread. The generated images are available at an API endpoint, and it shows the binary JPEG/PNG image (instead of base64 encoding).

The general intent of this project is to play with ideas for version 4 of [Easy Diffusion](https://github.com/easydiffusion/easydiffusion), and make it as lightweight, easy to install and fast as possible. Cutting out as much unnecessary bloat as possible.
