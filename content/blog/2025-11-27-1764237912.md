Managed to get [stable-diffusion.cpp](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp) integrated into [sdkit v3](https://github.com/easydiffusion/sdkit/tree/v3) and Easy Diffusion.

sdkit v3 wraps `stable-diffusion.cpp` with an API server. For now, the API server exposes an API compatible with Forge WebUI. This saves me time, and allows Easy Diffusion to work out-of-the-box with the new C++ based sdkit.

It compiles and runs quite well. Ran it with Easy Diffusion's UI. Tested with Vulkan and CUDA, on Windows.

There are a few [feature gaps](https://github.com/users/cmdr2/projects/16/views/5) (e.g. gfpgan, more controlnet models, more controlnet filters, more schedulers/samplers, reload specific models instead of everything), but `stable-diffusion.cpp` has come a long way over the past year. The performance is reasonable. Not as fast as Forge or diffusers, but respectable. I haven't spent any time on performance optimizations yet.

The next step is to figure out how to distribute this to Easy Diffusion's users. I'd especially like AMD users of Easy Diffusion to be able to use this ASAP (since AMD support is currently pretty unreliable). The Forge WebUI integration (i.e. ED 3.5) is currently sitting in the beta branch, but I don't want to wait until it's promoted to prod.
