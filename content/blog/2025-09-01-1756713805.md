Cleared the backlog of stale issues on ED's github repo. This brought down the number of open issues from ~350 to 74.

A number of those suggestions and issues are already being tracked on my [task board](https://github.com/users/cmdr2/projects/16/views/1). The others had either been fixed, or were really old (i.e. not relevant to reply anymore).

While I'd have genuinely wanted to solve all of those unresolved issues, I was on a break from this project for nearly 1.5 years, so unfortunately it is what it is.
